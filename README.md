A good analysis of the circuit can be found at [ElectroSmash](https://www.electrosmash.com/ruby-amp-analysis).

# Enclosure
The enclosure is build out of the bamboo planter [VILDAPEL](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/vildapel-uebertopf-bambus-90233613/) from IKEA.

# Speaker
For a speaker a cheap 8 &#8486; 92mm [paper membrane speaker](https://www.segor.de/#Q=L-92&M=1) was choosen. There is some debate that broadband HIFI speakers should be avoided (at least without a decent cabient simulation).
